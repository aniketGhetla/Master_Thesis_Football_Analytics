  <h2>Football Analytics System</h2>

  <p>
    Modern football increasingly demands tactical preparation and also pre-match and post-match evaluation grounded in
    objective data rather than intuition alone. Traditional approaches, often relying on manual video review or basic
    statistics, limit the ability of coaches and analysts to systematically study opponent behaviour and evaluate their
    own team’s strategies. While recent advances in tracking and event data have enabled automated analyses of formations
    and phases of play, most methods remain narrowly focused on expected goals (xG) and provide limited support for broader
    tactical planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    This thesis develops a football analytics system that assists teams in both pre-match preparation and post-match
    analysis. The system ingests open, publicly available event and tracking datasets and processes them through sequential
    layers: data injection, phase-of-play classification, formation detection, formation-vs-formation evaluation, tactical
    recommendation, and visualization via a Flask-based dashboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two novel contributions distinguish this work. First, the formation-vs-formation layer extends beyond xG by introducing
    additional tactical metrics—ball possession percentage, ball recovery rate, and a composite measure of team strength—
    yielding a more comprehensive assessment of how formations perform against one another. Second, the tactical
    recommendation layer leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model passing networks across phases of play and
    integrates them with knowledge graphs to recommend counter-formations and strategies tailored to opponent tendencies.
  </p>

  <p>
    All outputs are stored in a PostgreSQL database and presented through an interactive dashboard, allowing coaches and
    analysts to explore tactical insights systematically. By combining contextualised multi-metric formation analysis with
    AI-driven tactical recommendations, this thesis contributes a scalable framework for evidence-based preparation, enabling
    football teams to better analyse opponents and refine their own strategies in both pre-match planning and post-match
    review.

    For a live demonstration, see the dashboard pages (Pass Map, Pass Network, Shot Map, Pressing Heatmap, Formation-vs-Formation,
    and Tactical Recommendation). The system stores intermediate results in PostgreSQL tables and renders them through the
    Flask UI for interactive analysis.
